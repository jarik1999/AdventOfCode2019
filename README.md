# AdventOfCode2019

2019 programming challenges from adventofcode.com.

Note that this code is by no means beautiful. The idea is to get the solution as fast as possible which can lead to ugly code.

Days: 
  Contains the solutions for each day. Sometimes a second script is added for the second part of the question.
Days/helper.py:
  Contains some useful functions needed in several days. Drawing, math, IntCode computer etc.
Inputs:
